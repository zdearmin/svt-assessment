<!-- ABOUT -->
## About
This html app was developed in [HTML](https://html.com/), [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html), and [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) utilizing mostly [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling. The main function fetches JSON data from an API and displays it in table format.

Developed by [Zach Dearmin](https://github.com/zdearmin)

<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage
This app can be viewed a few different ways:
- Click and follow this [link](http://www.zachdearmin.com/svt-assessment/)

- Via the deployment page on [GitHub](https://github.com/zdearmin/svt-assessment/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages)

- Clone the repository to your local device, and from there you can drag and drop the .html file into your web browser. The HTTPS to clone the repo is below:
```
https://github.com/zdearmin/svt-assessment.git
```

Opening the HTML app will display a table of robots with each row containing a robot that includes: 
- Robot Id

- Battery Level

- X-Coordinate

- Y-Coordinate

Clicking on the table header for each column will sort the data in ascending or decending order. Each click will toggle to the opposite order.

<!-- Future Improvements -->
## Future Improvements
- Set up a grid layout that will plot the robots coordinates to see where they all are relative to the building and each other.

- With the grid layout above, also add another table that can quantitatively keep track of the distance of the robots from each other and other key locations in a building.

- The ability to add, update, or delete robots from the table. This would also require refactoring the code. One way is to store the JSON data from the initial fetch and then call the stored array into other functions when needed.

## Conclusion
Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this assessment. I continually learn more about development with each challenge I take on. 

I look forward to talking with you soon!

Best,
